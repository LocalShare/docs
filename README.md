## About LocalShare
LocalShare was an idea to solve the problem we faced in Iran (with slow internet connectivity), the idea of "Local Spotify-like music sharing".

We are trying to make that idea to work with our limited knowledge (as we're just a bunch of CS students ðŸ˜ƒ). We are planning to make it using web technologies like WebRTC, etc.

Stay tuned (if you're really interested).
